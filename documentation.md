# Technical Documentation for DWD App

The Discharge Without Delay app is a Dataverse for Teams canvas app. A demo of the functionality is at https://youtu.be/RysPS2_yItU but in general it is a database of patient information for patients admitted to acute hospital. New patients are created on the first screen, which shows a filterable and sortable list of all patients in the system. The Edit icon can be used to open a patient record. The patient record is spread across several tabs for each step in the discharge information-gathering process. There are notifications sent to various Teams channels for the acute and district teams when key data points are saved for a patient (e.g. PDD date is set).

## Data layer

There are 5 related Dataverse tables used by the app:
1. Patient: the primary table for all patient records, with 75+ fields. Several of the fields are internal choice fields.
2. District: table of district names (which must match the Teams channel names), their related Teams channel IDs, and links to the Teams tab where the app is deployed for that channel. These are used by Power Automate to post adapative cards to the correct channel that contain links to the app for easy access.
3. Hospital: table of hospital names and types (latter not used)
4. Ward: table of ward to hospital name mappings
5. UserPreference: table storing the last district, hospital, and ward filters applied by each user of the app so that the last filter applied can be persisted across sessions
Note that the DWD Audit table is imported with the solution but is no longer used.

There is an Excel file used to store an audit trail of each field that's changed by users. All fields changed by a user in one edit session are saved to a new row in this Excel file when the user clicks the save button in the app.

## Logic layer

There are 8 Power Automate flows used by the app:
1. New patient: When a new patient record is created in the Patients table, this flow fetches the District, Hospital, and ward information from the relevant tables, posts an adaptive card to the Teams channel for the district specified in the record,* and updates the patient record with a link to that adaptive card post to serve as the primary conversation thread in Teams about that patient's progress to discharge.
2. PDD Changed: When a user changes the PDD field for a patient, the varPDDchanged variable in the app is set to true, and this flow is then triggered when the user saves the record. The flow uses the CHI number it's sent by the app to look up the patient record, get the district for that patient, and then post an adaptive card in the Teams channel for that district updating the community team that the acute team has set this date.
3. DMT Changed: Same as above, but the card is posted to the General channel (or whichever channel is being used by the acute team).
4. Viable Date Changed: Same as above, but the card is posted to the General channel (or whichever channel is being used by the acute team).
5. Save Audit for Patient Edit: Each time a patient record is saved, this flow is run which uses the CHI number to look up the newly changed record, the relevant hospital, ward, and district names, and the identity of the user making the change. It then saves all of this to a new row in a table of the XLSX file installed in the deployment.** 
6. ExportPDFtoSharepoint: Triggered by the export screen in the app, it takes the patient name, CHI number, and PDF file generated by the app and creates a new PDF file in the location configured in the final step.
7. Delete patient record: Deletes ALL rows in the Patients table matching the CHI number of the record the user has confirmed to delete. Note that there should only be one patient record for any given CHI number in the system at any time (unless users aren't consistently deleting records on discharge).
8. Daily check, DHD: Each day at 8am, it checks each Patient record that has a PDD date populated. If the PDD date is older than today, it sets the DHD flag to Yes. Note that only the app owner can go into the database to change this flag. This is by design.

## App layer

There is a fair amount of logic contained in the scripts in the Discharge Coordination PowerApp. Below is a description of the major UI components and important logic scripts in them.

The architecture makes use of "containers" to provide a responsive design that expands/shrinks for different screen sizes. 

The App object only has the OnStart parameter configured to:
- Set several variables
- Create a record in UserPreferences for the current user if there isn't one

There are four screens in the app:
- list: The home screen showing a list of all patients in the Patients table
- editpatientform: The edit screen for a patient record
- export: A screen collating all the fields for a patient record into one view for export to PDF
- newpatient: A separate screen for creating a new patient record with the minimum required fields

List Screen:
- OnVisible sets the varNextAction variable to 0. varNextAction is used to filter the list for who has the next action.
- List_topbar container has icons that change the sorting variables with OnSelect. The Icon parameter also changes based on the sorting variables. The width of the icons are based on the width of the header titles in the container below. The New Patient button simply navigates to the newpatient screen OnSelect.
- List_header container is mostly headings with Width params set to the same fractions of the parent.width as their data items in the list_container below. The District drop down has an important script in the OnChange param which filters the patientlist gallery and sets the user preferences for district, hospital, and ward based on the current selections.
- List_container just contains the patientlist gallery. Its Items param has the important sort and filter script which uses the three drop downs and varNextAction to filter the list. If varNextAction = 1 and atBat = true, the list will only show records for whom the community is now responsible for the next action. If varNextAction = 1 and atBat = false, it will only show records that are for acute's action. The atbat_label and Decision_label text params use emoticons to show the symbols. The PDD_label, discharge_label, and Pathway_label Text and Color params have conditional statements that change the text and color based on record values. The edit_icon creates a new collection variable (varCurrentPatient) and adds the patient name and CHI to it. This is to collect changes for the audit. It then navigates to the edit screen. The chat_icon navigates to the URL for the Teams conversations created by the New Patient flow.

The Delegation warnings in the app are known. It's not anticipated that there will be any more than 500 patients in the system at any one time, so these formulas are at low risk of causing any issues. If that assumption changes, the delegation limit will need to be increased or the formulas refactored.


"*" All the adaptive cards in the flows include references in the "text" elements to items in the Patient record in Dataverse. All the "text" elements can be edited as you see fit, or you can replace the entire card with a new design you can create with https://www.adaptivecards.io/designer/  Note also there is a URL element that includes a link to a logo file that you will need to replace, or remove the entire "Image" item in the first "Column".

"**" This could be optimised to save only those fields changed by the user, but I couldn't get this to work. As a result, this file may grow large and need to be cleansed with old rows archived elsewhere periodically.
